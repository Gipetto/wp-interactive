This plugin allows admin users to run PHP code directly via the admin-ajax functionality in WordPress to assist with development of plugins and themes. It is NOT recommended for production environments.

- Allows user to enter PHP code to be directly executed inside a WordPress scoped environment
- Users can save common snippets for re-use

== Installation ==

Installation is easy:

1. Upload the `wp-interactive` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Will you hate me if I put this on a Production Server? =

Yes.

= Will it work properly on IIS or Windows based servers? =

I have no idea! There's some file path translation stuff that'll probably fail. I don't personally develop on Windows but will make any adjustments as needed if someone wants to test and submit any necessary fixes.
